                Hi, my name is Chris Lam! I have an extreme passion for web development using all sorts of
                libraries along interests in building personal projects in Python regarding artificial intelligence
                and digital imaging.
                Thriving on facing challenges head on, it builds my adaptability and resilience in the
                process.
                <br/>
                I am aiming to pursue a Masters in CS to further my capabilities and expand my knowledge!!
                With my leadership, attitude, and coding skills towards project-based learning, I strive to
                collaborate with diverse individuals and teams to create positive change.
